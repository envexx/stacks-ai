### 3. Vision - Problem Statement

**Recommended Text (150-200 words):**

```
Traditional AI API services force users into expensive monthly subscriptions 
($20-200/month) regardless of actual usage, creating barriers for:

1. Casual users who only need AI occasionally
2. Developers in emerging markets without credit cards
3. Projects requiring transparent, verifiable payment trails
4. Users seeking privacy without centralized payment processors

Additionally, existing payment systems lack:
- Transparency: Hidden fees and unclear pricing
- Accessibility: 1.7 billion unbanked people excluded
- Verification: No on-chain proof of payment
- Fairness: Pay for unused capacity

StacksAI solves this by implementing the x402-stacks protocol, enabling 
blockchain-verified micropayments for AI access. Users pay only for what 
they use (as low as $0.04 per prompt) using STX tokens, with every 
transaction verified on the Stacks blockchain and secured by Bitcoin.

This creates a fairer, more accessible AI ecosystem while demonstrating 
real-world utility for the Stacks blockchain beyond DeFi applications.
```

**Alternative Shorter Version (100 words):**

```
AI services lock users into expensive subscriptions ($20-200/month) even 
for occasional use, excluding billions without credit cards. StacksAI 
implements the x402-stacks protocol to enable blockchain-verified 
micropayments - users pay only per prompt (from $0.04) using STX tokens. 

Every payment is transparent, verifiable on-chain, and secured by Bitcoin 
through Stacks' Proof of Transfer. This solves accessibility, transparency, 
and fairness issues while showcasing practical Stacks blockchain utility 
beyond DeFi.

### 4. Category

**Recommended Category:**
```
DeFi / Payments
```

- Demonstrates micropayment use case
- Blockchain-verified transactions
- If "AI" category exists, that's also appropriate

### 5. Is this BUIDL an AI Agent?

```
No
```

**Explanation:**
- StacksAI is a payment gateway/platform
- It provides ACCESS to AI models (GPT-4, Claude)
- It is NOT itself an AI agent
- The AI processing is done by OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
